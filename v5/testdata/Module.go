/*
Package "module" defines type aliases for the commonly used types defined in the
packages contained in this module.  It also provides a universal constructor for
each commonly used class that is exported by the module.  Each constructor
delegates the actual construction process to its corresponding concrete class
defined in the corresponding package contained within this module.

For detailed documentation on this entire module refer to the wiki:
