/*
AngleClassLike is a class interface that declares the complete set of class
constructors, constants and functions that must be supported by each concrete
angle-like class.

An angle-like class provides the functionality required by the concept of a
mathematical angle.

The following class functions are supported:

Sine() returns the mathematical ratio of y/r for the angle.

Cosine() returns the mathematical ratio of x/r for the angle.

Tangent() returns the mathematical ratio of y/x for the angle.

An array-like class maintains a fixed length indexed sequence of values.  Each
value is associated with an implicit positive integer index. An array-like class
uses ORDINAL based indexing rather than the more common—and nonsensical—ZERO
based indexing scheme.

The following class functions are supported:

Merge() returns a new array containing all of the values that are in the
specified arrays in the order that they appear in each array.

class constructors, constants and functions that must be supported by each
concrete catalog-like class.

The following class functions are supported:

Extract() returns a new catalog containing only the associations that are in the
specified catalog that have the specified keys.  The associations in the
resulting catalog will be in the same order as the specified keys.

Merge() returns a new catalog containing all of the associations that are in the
specified catalogs in the order that they appear in each catalog.  If a key is
present in both catalogs, the value of the key from the second catalog takes
precedence.

/*
IteratorClassLike[V any] is a class interface that declares the complete set
of class constructors, constants and functions that must be supported by each
concrete iterator-like class.

An iterator-like class can be used to move forward and backward over the values
in an array.  It implements the Gang of Four (GoF) Iterator Design Pattern:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern

An iterator agent locks into the slots that reside between each value in the
sequence:

	  . [value 1] . [value 2] . [value 3] ... [value N] .
	  ^           ^           ^                         ^
	slot 0      slot 1      slot 2                    slot N

It moves from slot to slot and has access to the values (if they exist) on each
side of the slot.  At each slot an iterator has access to the previous value
and next value in the array (assuming they exist). The slot at the start of
the array has no PREVIOUS value, and the slot at the end of the array has no
NEXT value.  The size of the array is static so that its values can be modified
during iteration.
