## Go Code Generation

### Overview
This project provides template-based code generation capabilities that allow
the generation of a Go module containing a `grammar` package defining a parser,
validator and formatter for a specified `syntax.cdsn` file.  An `ast` package
containing a class for each node in the corresponding _abstract syntax tree_ is
also generated.

⚠️  Note: This is a very complex project to understand and use.  To take full
advantage of the code generation capabilities, click on the "command-line tools"
link below.
